# Changelog

## 0.3.1

Update a footprint of a resistor to match with JLCPCB basic parts repository.

## 0.3.0

Stop using buffers for the input stage.
Since we use non-inverting buffers, they add noise & hum.
With inverting buffers we need to face with phase issues. (L->R)
So, now we get rid of those buffers & simply rely on voltage dividers.

## 0.2.0
Introduce proper input buffering and normaling.
Left channel will be normaled to right channel if no right input
is provided.
Also now we use MCP6002 Opamps.

## 0.1.0
Initial Release
