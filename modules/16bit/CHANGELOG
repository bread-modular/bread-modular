## 1.5.3
Make sure rumble is disabled by default

## 1.5.2
Fix delay logic issues with low FPS values.

## 1.5.1
Rumble FX was not allowed to configure from the 16bit firmware.
It's added now

## 1.5.0
Introduce a Techno Rumble FX for the Sampler App


## 1.4.0
Introduce performance improvement for all the apps.
This is done my marking hot/cold paths of the codebase
to run audiocallack as fast as possible.

## 1.3.0
Introduce the Elab app on 16bit

## 1.2.1
Fix the envelope not functioning issue in the polysynth app.

## 1.2.0

fx section and send the audio-out.

## 1.1.0
Introduce the 16bit firmware with apps.
There's no hardware changes in this version.

## 1.0.0
Revert the Digital In/Out support.
And add more space for captions. So, they look a bit more visible.

## 0.3.0
Add Digital Audio In/Out Support
Add some hardware support for digital audio in/out via some 
custom pio based protocol between 16bits.
This allows us to send audio between 16 bits instances digitally.

## 0.2.0

Add PSRAM support.
Use 1k resistor for the DAC low pass filter.
This sets output impedance to 1k and the put -3db cutoff points to 15k
Currently it's around 1500hz and that's not good.

## 0.1.0
Initialize Release
