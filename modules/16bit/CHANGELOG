## 0.3.0
Add Digital Audio In/Out Support
Add some hardware support for digital audio in/out via some 
custom pio based protocol between 16bits.
This allows us to send audio between 16 bits instances digitally.

## 0.2.0

Add PSRAM support.
Use 1k resistor for the DAC low pass filter.
This sets output impedance to 1k and the put -3db cutoff points to 15k
Currently it's around 1500hz and that's not good.

## 0.1.0
Initialize Release
