# Changelog

## 0.4.0
Add input grounding

## 0.3.0
Add left to right channel input normalling.
This way we can make sure when we have mono setup, both channels of the 
headphone get the input without any additional wiring.

## 0.2.0
Add More Volume

We do this by simply changing the opamp resisotors and basically act as a buffer for the input.
The input potentiometer controls the volume.
We removed the transitor as it's not really needed. Opamp can handle the power delivery.

## 0.1.0
Initial Release
