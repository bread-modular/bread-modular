# Changelog

## 1.0.3
midi: Send MIDI data to ch8.
It's connected to the PB2 (TX) and now we send MIDI data to it.

## 1.0.2
Listening to MIDI realtime data (clocks) and broadcast them
to all the channels

## 1.0.1
Change the caption to UPDI from UDPI

## 1.0.0

Release 1.0.0

## 0.5.0
Fix instability in MIDI recieving.
We were adding 10K resistor between the MIDI ground and the common ground.
Which makes some MIDI devices(i.e. Elektron) to behave weirdly.
Now we simply connect it to the ground.

Also added some debug code in the firmware too.
(Which is commented out for now) 

## 0.4.1
Consider velocity=0 as MIDI_NOTE_OFF command.
Some devices may not send MIDI_NOTE_OFF command but instead
they will send MIDI_NOTE_ON with velocity=0
(Usually Elektron devices)

## 0.4.0
Connect MIDI GND to the common GND

## 0.3.1
Add support for MIDI CC routing via a firmware update.
Now we also a custom written Simple MIDI parsing library.

## 0.3.0
Add support to select MIDI A or MIDI B. Now we can attach a toggle or use
some jumpers select the type A or B.

## 0.2.1
No changes in the code or schematics. But simply porting the
Arduino codebase to Platform.io

## 0.2.0
Implemented Modular MIDI and Gate Support.
Now we use ATTiny 1616 as the MCU

## 0.1.0
Initial Release
